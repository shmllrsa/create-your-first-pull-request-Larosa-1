I hope it will be a fun semester and I expect myself to strive harder too. If there will be groupings for the exercises, I hope my group mates are kind, patient, and hard working. 

Toledo's comments: I share the hopes that this semester will be a fun one. I also agree that it is good to constantly push yourself into trying harder to unlock more of your potential in this new semester. Let's hope together that our groupmates this semester will have those good qualities you listed.
